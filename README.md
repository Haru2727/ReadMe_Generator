## Installation

    You will "REQUIRE" inquirer, fs, and util method libaries in order to run this generator.  The code can be found in my github repository.

## Usgae

    WHEN a user enters information related to the prompts, the application will create a new README.md file or overwrite the current one in the folder.  This will help web developers get more time to code and test the application in order to reach deadlines.
